### 1.2 App Description

**Description (max 4000 characters):**

```
Block is the bold habit tracker that adapts to your life — not the other way around.

FLEXIBLE SCHEDULING
Not every habit is daily. Set habits for specific days, X times per week, or custom intervals. Block shows only what's scheduled today so you stay focused.

TRACK MORE THAN YES/NO
Count glasses of water, log minutes of reading, or track any quantity. Set daily targets and watch your progress bar fill up.

STREAK FREEZES
Life happens. Block automatically protects your streak when you miss a scheduled day — so one off day doesn't erase weeks of progress.

QUICK START TEMPLATES
Choose from 20+ habit templates to get started in seconds. Drink Water, Meditate, Deep Work, Exercise — pick a few during onboarding and you're tracking in under a minute.

BEAUTIFUL STATISTICS
Understand your progress with frequency-aware stats. Completion rates that actually reflect your schedule, not just calendar days.
